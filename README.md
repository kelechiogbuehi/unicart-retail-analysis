## Recommendations
 - Continue implementing policies introduced in 2024, which have successfully reduced the high return rate recorded in 2023.
 - Promote products in Apparel, Kitchen Utensil, Furniture, Electronics, Accessories and Home decor categories, as they consistently underperform compared to others.  - - - Increased promotions and visibility will be beneficial.
 - Expand efforts in the US market, where performance has remained relatively flat over the past five years. Greater awareness and presence in this market could significantly boost sales.

## Conclusion
Unicart Retail Group has maintained steady sales growth from 2020–2025, with strong contributions from the Electronic Gadget category and balanced customer preferences across payment methods. While return rates have improved since 2023, underperforming product categories and the untapped potential in the US market present clear opportunities for growth. Strengthening these areas will position Unicart Retail Group for sustained performance in the years ahead.
